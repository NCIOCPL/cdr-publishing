Subject: Review of PDQ/Cancer.gov protocol abstract

Enclosed for your review is the abstract of your protocol, @@PROTOCOLID@@,
entitled ``@@PROTOCOLTITLE@@.''  This abstract is ready for listing, or is
currently listed, in the National Cancer Institute's PDQ/Cancer.gov
clinical trials database.

Please review the printout and make any changes to the abstract directly on
the printout.  Please pay particular attention to the disease retrieval terms,
which are the cancer types, stages, or conditions used to describe the
trial.  These terms are used for accurate retrieval of this trial on the
Cancer.gov Web site.

Please note that the title may have been modified on Cancer.gov to adhere to a
standard PDQ/Cancer.gov protocol title format.  This format usually includes
the phase of study; drugs, agents or modalities under study; and eligible
diseases or conditions.  Descriptions of endpoints and objectives are
generally not included in the PDQ/Cancer.gov title.  If you have any concerns
about using our format for your abstract, please alert us to these concerns
when you return the abstract printout.

If significant changes are made in the scientific design of the study, then we
need to receive an IRB approved protocol amendment or a copy of the revised
protocol so that we may incorporate the information accurately into the
protocol abstract.  If a study was originally reviewed by the PDQ/Cancer.gov
Editorial Board prior to listing, the amendment may be re-reviewed prior to
incorporation into PDQ/Cancer.gov.

If the information in the abstract is accurate and no changes are needed,
please initial as indicated on the last page of the attached abstract.  Return
the entire abstract printout in the enclosed self-addressed envelope, or fax
back the initialed form and any changes made to the abstract.  It is important
that your review be returned as soon as possible.  We will ask you to review
the protocol abstract annually as long as the protocol is active.

Health professionals from around the world use the PDQ/Cancer.gov clinical
trials database, available on the NCI's Cancer.gov Web site
(http://cancer.gov), to identify and refer patients to clinical trials for
which they may be eligible.  PDQ/Cancer.gov clinical trials information is
also available through the NCI's Cancer Information Service (1-800-4-CANCER)
and several online services.

Thank you for your assistance in keeping PDQ/Cancer.gov up-to-date.  If you
have any questions, please feel free to contact the PDQ/Cancer.gov Protocol
Coordinator at ***REMOVED*** or send email to pdqprot@cips.nci.nih.gov.
