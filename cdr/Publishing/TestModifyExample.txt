# Example control file for TestModifyPubProcsCG.py
# 
# Use a file in this format to force manipulations of the 
# pub_proc_cg and doc_version tables in order to make some
# documents publish.
# 
# Format of the file:
#    Leading and trailing whitespace are ignored (stripped)
#    '#' as first non-whitespace char makes whole line a comment
#        (it must be the first non ws char.)
# Keywords
#   =PubAsNewDocs
#     Following docs will be deleted from pub_proc_cg
#
#   =ChangeDocs
#     Following docs will have XML modified in pub_proc_cg
# 
#   =NewVersionDocs
#     Following docs will have last publishable version
#     extracted and re-stored as a new publishable version,
#     plus xml will be modified in pub_proc_cg.
#
#   =InactivateDocs
#    Following docs will have the active_status set to 'I' in the
#    document table, causing document removal at the next
#    publishing run if the documents were previously active.
#
#   =ReactivateDocs
#    Following docs will have active_status set to 'A' in the
#    document table.  This will cause republishing of the docs if
#    they were previously inactive and removed.
#
# DocIDs
#   List them after keywords, one per line, no CDR000... prefix.
#
# Block comments
#   An entire block can be commented out with:
#      /*:sp
#      ...
#      */
#   Comment delimiters must stand alone on a line.
#
# WARNING!
#   After editing a control file, ALWAYS run it through
#       TestModifyPubProcsCG.py userid pw test
#   Test mode will detect any doc IDs which are not in
#   pub_proc_cg or for which no publishable version exists.
#
#   After one run of the program, any =PubAsNewDocs will fail
#   the test on a subsequent run unless publishing intervenes.
